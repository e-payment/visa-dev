# Java sample code for Visa API calls


## Installation

You must have Maven installed. Install the dependencies using :

    $ mvn install
	 
## Usage

For generating you jks using the steps below :

 Place your private key file (e.g. privateKey.pem) and your certificate file from VDP (e.g. cert.pem) in the same directory. Generate a keystore (e.g. myapp_keyAndCertBundle.p12) file as shown below.

	openssl pkcs12 -export -in cert.pem -inkey "privateKey.pem" -certfile cert.pem -out myapp_keyAndCertBundle.p12

 To get the Java Key Store, run the following Java keytool command to convert your P12 file to JKS file

	keytool -importkeystore -srckeystore myapp_keyAndCertBundle.p12 -srcstoretype PKCS12 -destkeystore myapp_keyAndCertBundle.jks

 Run the following Java keytool command to validate the contents of your new JKS file.

	keytool -list -v -keystore myapp_keyAndCertBundle.jks

 Run the following command to add the root certificate to your JKS file.

	keytool -import -alias ejbca -keystore myapp_keyAndCertBundle.jks -file VDPCA-SBX.pem -storepass <password>

Fill up the required values in the file `configuration.properties` located under the folder `resources`. To find more more information on `configuration.properties` refer :

* [Manual](https://github.com/visa/SampleCode/wiki/Manual)

To run these API calls give the command as shown below :
    
    $ mvn test

The tests are written using TestNG. You can also run tests for specific products by passing `-Dgroups=Group#name`. For example :

	$ mvn test -Dgroups=mlc


You would need to generate a Call Id for calling Visa Checkout. The documentation for generating Call Id can be found at :

* [Visa Checkout Guide](https://github.com/visa/SampleCode/wiki/Visa-Checkout)

Auto-population of test data is available only for Visa Transaction Alerts for now. We are working on this and will try to further improve your experience by generating it for other products as well.

The sample code provided reads the credentials from configuration file as plain text. As a best practice we recommend you to store the credentials in an encrypted form and decrypt while using them.
