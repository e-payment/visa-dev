# PHP Sample Code for Visa API calls

## Installation

To install the dependencies run the following command :

	$ composer install

## Usage

We use phpunit to run our sample calls

Update the `configuration.ini` file under the `root` folder. For more information on `configuration.ini` refer :
	 
* [Manual](https://github.com/visa/SampleCode/wiki/Manual)

Then you can run the API calls using the command below:
    
    $ ./vendor/bin/phpunit

To run an individual test file :

	$ ./vendor/bin/phpunit tests/atmlocator/LocateAtmApiTest.php

You would need to generate a Call Id for calling Visa Checkout. The documentation for generating Call Id can be found at :

* [Visa Checkout Guide](https://github.com/visa/SampleCode/wiki/Visa-Checkout)

Auto-population of test data is available only for Visa Transaction Alerts for now. We are working on this and will try to further improve your experience by generating it for other products as well.

The sample code provided reads the credentials from configuration file as plain text. As a best practice we recommend you to store the credentials in an encrypted form and decrypt while using them.
